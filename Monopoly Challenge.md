# Software Development

## Development Challenge


### Introduction

This challenge aims to allow you to put into practice much of the knowledge, skills and behaviors we have learned and acquired during the course.

You are going to develop a game based on the popular board game Monopoly using a programming language and a development methodology of your choice. You may need to do some research to familiarize yourself with the game and the rules.

You are not expected to deliver a fully functional game but should aim to add as much value to your product as you can in the time available in agreement with your stakeholders or product owner.

This is a learning exercise and not an assessment.

### Method
